# Walmart Customer Support System Transformation  
**Project Framework:** Traditional / Waterfall  
**Project Type:** Enterprise System Transformation  

---

##  Project Overview
This project is an independent, end-to-end project management case study focused on transforming customer-facing support systems handling returns, refunds, and complaints. The initiative addresses slow resolution times caused by fragmented tools, manual workflows, and limited visibility across customer cases.

---

##  Business Problem
Customer support operations experience delayed issue resolution, high escalation rates, and inconsistent customer experiences due to legacy systems and disconnected workflows. These issues directly impact customer satisfaction, operational costs, and brand trust.

---

##  Proposed Solution (High-Level)
Implement a centralized, modern customer support platform that:
- Integrates all customer support channels
- Automates common return and refund workflows
- Provides real-time case visibility and analytics
- Standardizes SLAs and escalation paths

---

##  Framework Selection
A **Traditional / Waterfall** approach was selected due to:
- High integration and data migration risks
- Need for formal approvals and governance
- Fixed scope and compliance requirements
- Large-scale operational impact
